# Functional Programming for Ruby developer

Functional programming is an alternative paradigm to OOP. Instead of applications being a composition of objects passing messages, our applications compose functions.

### Ruby -> Proc -> lambda

Lambdas are a powerful feature of the Ruby language. They allow you to wrap logic and data into a portable package.

- "A lambda function encapsulates control flow, parameters and local variables into a single package assigned to a variable or used inline. If assigned to a variable, it can be passed to other functions or stored in data structures, just like a more typical variable containing a string or float. A lambda function can then be executed far from the code location where it was defined. Lambda functions are often called anonymous functions or a function literal."
